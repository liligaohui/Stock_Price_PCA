# Project 1 – Factors Influencing Stock Price Movements

This project explores the potential factors that may influence stock price changes. Rather than focusing on price prediction, the goal is to identify which macroeconomic or company-specific variables are statistically associated with stock returns.

## Objectives
- Understand key drivers of price movements for selected stocks
- Test explanatory power of multiple variables (e.g. interest rates, volume, company financial data)
- Use statistical models to quantify relationships

## Approach
- Collected data from various sources (e.g. Yahoo Finance, interest rate, inflation rate)
- Built a multi-variable regression model (OLS) using Python
- Interpreted coefficients and R² values to evaluate influence levels

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib)
- Data sources: Yahoo Finance, FRED, Bloomberg

## Key Takeaways
- Demonstrated ability to clean and merge diverse financial datasets
- Applied regression modeling to identify potential key factors
- Gained insights into real-world market drivers beyond price charts
